        <p>Van Halen <a href="_">(/væn ˈheɪlɛn/ van HAY-len)</a> is an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California
            in 1972. Credited
            with "restoring hard rock to the forefront of the music scene",[7] Van Halen is known for its energetic live
            shows[8] and for the work of its acclaimed lead guitarist, Eddie Van Halen.[9][10] The band was inducted
            into
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.

        <p>From 1974 until 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen; Eddie's brother, drummer <a href="_">Alex Van
                Halen</a>; vocalist
            David Lee Roth; and bassist Michael Anthony.[11] Upon its release in 1978, the band's self-titled debut
            album
            reached No. 19 on the Billboard pop music charts and would go on to sell over 10 million copies in the U.S.
            From
            1979 to 1982, the band released four albums (Van Halen II, Women and Children First, Fair Warning, and Diver
            Down), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the
            most
            successful rock acts of the time.[12] The album 1984 was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million
            copies and four hit singles; its lead single, "Jump", is the band's only U.S. number one single to date and
            was
            internationally known.

        <p>In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist
            Sammy
            Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11
            years
            (5150 in 1986, OU812 in 1988, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge in 1991, and Balance in 1995). Hagar left the
            band
            in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best Of – Volume I. Former
            Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album Van Halen III
            with
            the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in
            2003
            for a worldwide tour in 2004 and the double-disc greatest hits collection <a href="_">The Best of Both
                Worlds.</a> Hagar again
            left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006, Roth returned as lead vocalist and Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by
            Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son. In 2012, the band released the commercially and critically successful A
            Different Kind of Truth.

            <a href="_">best-selling groups of all time.</a>[15][16][17] As of 2007, Van Halen was one of only five rock
            bands with two
            studio albums that sold more than 10 million copies in the United States[18] and is also tied for the most
